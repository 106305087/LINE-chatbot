# LINE-chatbot
This project was conducted in a “Programming 101” class with two other members, and I was the group leader to manage the whole project timeline. We utilized Python to develop a chatbot on LINE, a popular message platform in Taiwanese, to provide users with different functions they frequently use in their daily lives. The chatbot can search for lunar calendar, latest news and buy movie tickets. I was responsible for building the movie-related function. Besides showing the movie ranking, information and reviews, the most challenging task was to build a ticket-buying function. I was also in charge of integrating all the functions and deploying them on the LINE platform to make the chatbot work smoothly. Our group received an A+ in the final project.
